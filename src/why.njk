  <h1>But... but why?</h1>
  <h2>tl;dr:</h2>
  <p>
    Zach Leatherman <em>made</em> me do it.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      free side project idea: HTML-only static site generated clock that deploys a new version to <a href="https://twitter.com/netlify">@netlify</a> every minute
    </p>

  <h2>Easy, automated deploys</h2>
  <p>
    This site is made of static HTML. There is no javascript running to detect the time in your timezone and to display it to you.
  </p>
  <p>
    Instead, <a href="/">the time you see</a> is the time that the site was generated and deployed. It just so happens that building and deploying with Netlify is so easy, so frictionless, and so confident, that I felt comfortable rebuilding and deploying the site to Netlify's intelligent global CDN <em>every minute</em>.
  </p>
  <h2>Localization via the CDN</h2>
  <p>
    When you access this site, the CDN notices where in the world you are, and if a route has been generate for your country, it will automatically serve you the page which was generated for it. There <a href="/timezones">isn't a comprehensive list</a>, but you can always extend it with a <a href="{{ pkg.repository.url }}">pull request</a>!
